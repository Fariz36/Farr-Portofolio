# Website Portofolio

### Hey there!

Thanks for checking out this project.
This project is website project that built using HTML, CSS, and little JavaScript. This project was build by next.js framework, and it was my first time using next.js. Overall, i think i really satisfied with my project result, eventought there is a lot of thing to be improved. Funfact, This website was build in less than 3 day lol.

Now, if you want to run locally, you need to do some steps. No need to worry, I’ll guide you every step of the way.

### Before We Start

First things first—you’ll need a few things:
- **Node.js**: Make sure you’ve got it installed. Version 14 or later works best.
- **npm or Yarn**: Pick your favorite package manager. Both get the job done.

### Getting the Code

Alright, time to grab the code. Open up your terminal and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Fariz36/Farr-Portofolio.git
```

This will pull down the project to your local machine. Once it’s done, move into the project folder:
```
cd porto
```

## Installing Dependencies
Next up, we need to get npm installed. 
If you haven't yet install npm, here you need to do:
open up your terminal, then write this command
```
npm install
```

## Running the Project Locally
After you make sure all the dependencies already installed, you can just write this command:
```
npm run dev
```

now the project should be running! open your browser and open
```
http://localhost:3000
```
